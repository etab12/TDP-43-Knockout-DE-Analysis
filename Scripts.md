# Here are all the transcripts needed to analyze the raw RNA-Seq data:

1- Quality Control & Trimming with FASTQC, FASTP, and MultiQC
2- Pseudo Alignment& Quantification  with Salmon (due to the time and computational resources, we go with this approach instead of the traditional alignment)
3- Differential Expression Analysis with DESeq2 
4- Pathway Enrichment Analysis
